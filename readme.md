A Hangman-Style Game in the Terminal!

Working, so far... 

A random word is selected and generated at the beginning of game play.
The Word object is linked to the Letter object.
Inquirer used to prompt user to Guess a Letter.
The letter function checks user guess against the random word.

Work still in progress...
